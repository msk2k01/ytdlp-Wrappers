    - refactored to compartmentalize steps into functions
    - if downloading a playlist that doesn't have an existing archive, the --age flag will be ignored and all videos will be downloaded.
        - if the output folder exists, but not an archive.txt, execution stops as this could lead to unintended behavior.
    - "press enter to continue" before yt-dlp starts, so user can confirm intended behavior from terminal output
    - refined terminal output
    - improved archive folder naming to attempt parsing the same folder name that yt-dlp would using --restrict-filenames. The following cases were handled and tested:
        - non-UTF8; "; &                    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSBWvYm8t6uYJV3UwJdLSLfoMfNAJXY0r
